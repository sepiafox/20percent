Development Journal of "The Flash Project"

Week of February 1 2015
This week I researched how I could make a flash game with programs accessible to me. I also began to write the code for the program after looking at several tutorials about flash and actionscript. I am currently using FlashDevelop IDE to write the code, and I downloaded Flixel, a lybrary of common mechanics used in flash games. As far as coding goes, I have most of the main classes set out. These classes are the preloader, the main game file, and a state. I also have some basic specifications inside the classes like size and base background color. As far as the style of the actual game is involved, I have planned what I'm going to aim for. It will be a five-level platformer, each level with a single opponent. Each opponent will have a unique "power" that the player will gain after defeating them. Powers I'm considering are speed boost, teleportation accross the screen, infinite jump, and phasing through solid barriers. Which ones I use will probably be determined by how easy they are to incorperate into the game. The fifth and final boss will probably have all of the powers like the player by the end of the game.

This week I continued researching on how to make the basic flash application I had made work. This simple flash application just shows a static screen of a single color and specified size. I was using it's compilation to find any basic, setup related problems with how I was compiling and running projects before I went on to more complex things. I downloaded and assigned the proper SDK to the FlashDevelop Project and associated Flash Player with opening .SWF files. I also configured the debugger compiler. Additionally, I assigned my PlayState.as file to be my Document Class, or "Main", which was essential for the program to run, but that I had forgotten earlier. The game still does not compile, but that is due to an internal syntax error now, not the way the FlashDevelop project is set up. As far as conceptual game design goes, I have expanded in that area as well. Each of the five levels and bosses will have it's own state file. I may have a Menu state, depending on how easy it is, but that is not neccisarily essential and will be done last if at all.

This week I worked to fix existing syntax errors in compilation. I also experimented with different ways to execute my SWF file once it was compilable. I am currently just sending the SWF file link to my browser to play using Flash's web player, but if that turns out to not work I may have to install an internal player. I also tried rearranging file configurations to fix my compiler's problem of not being able to see the SWF file. This may be related to the way the SWF is executed, since both problems involve configuring the SWF, but I doubt it, as the error message (which is displayed in FlashDevelop whether I use the stricter Debug mode of compilation or just the release mode) describes not being able to find the file at all, rather than not being able to execute it. As far as game design goes, I have delved a bit into the artistic side and have a pretty good idea, after sketching a bit, what my characters and rooms will look like. I have yet to make finalized spritesheets on the computer and plan interesting obstacles for the rooms though. Lastly, I have deleted some unneccisary code from Playstate.

This week I focused on integrating flixel into a project successfully and putting the final touches on making sure the technicalities of smooth compiling were in place. The latter I accomplished by making a test project and adjusting the dimensions and color of the SWF to make sure my internal flash player wasn't just giving me a blank white screen. I also noted that this perfectly functioning project would become uncompilable (giving the error of it not bieng able to find the SWF file) if I tried compiling it with flixel incorrectly integrated, even if I deleted all the flixel code and project associations and saved it again. This would affect all projects and was only remedied by xing everything out and restarting the computer. However, after starting clean a few times I got a "Hello World" tester project working. FlashDevelop integrated and recognized the Flixel game lybrary and Flash fully rendering the SWF. I have replaced the 20percentproject file with this working tester project, named 20PERCENT. This is a major step forward - I can focus more on the objects in the actual game now instead of worrying about compliling problems.

Week of March 1 2015 - Checkpoint 1
I have finished the most major aspects of the game mechanics, completing the objective of getting the core mechanics working. I have made a sprite with moveable controls, which I am working on creating jump mechanics for right now. I have gravity mechanics done and controllable with variables. I also have a tiled background based on a binary data array. The background has working edge and block collisions, and the images it displays were made by me in gimp. The sprite's current animation art is a stock hooded figure, but I have the art for my own sprite almost completed. I just have to line each frame up right in the spritesheet so my sprite isn't displaced or cut off. The compiler has functioned well the entire time this week and all errors have been syntax-based. I have seperated the player controls and tilemap controls into thier own seperate classes, as well as try out several different images for my tilemap (which is why my tilemap image is called tilemap14).
