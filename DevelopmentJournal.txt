Development Journal of "The Flash Project"

This week I researched how I could make a flash game with programs accessible to me. I also began to write the code for the program after looking at several tutorials about flash and actionscript. I am currently using FlashDevelop IDE to write the code, and I downloaded Flixel, a lybrary of common mechanics used in flash games. As far as coding goes, I have most of the main classes set out. These classes are the preloader, the main game file, and a state. I also have some basic specifications inside the classes like size and base background color. As far as the style of the actual game is involved, I have planned what I'm going to aim for. It will be a five-level platformer, each level with a single opponent. Each opponent will have a unique "power" that the player will gain after defeating them. Powers I'm considering are speed boost, teleportation accross the screen, infinite jump, and phasing through solid barriers. Which ones I use will probably be determined by how easy they are to incorperate into the game. The fifth and final boss will probably have all of the powers like the player by the end of the game.

This week I continued researching on how to make the basic flash application I had made work. This simple flash application just shows a static screen of a single color and specified size. I was using it's compilation to find any basic, setup related problems with how I was compiling and running projects before I went on to more complex things. I downloaded and assigned the proper SDK to the FlashDevelop Project and associated Flash Player with opening .SWF files. I also configured the debugger compiler. Additionally, I assigned my PlayState.as file to be my Document Class, or "Main", which was essential for the program to run, but that I had forgotten earlier. The game still does not compile, but that is due to an internal syntax error now, not the way the FlashDevelop project is set up. As far as conceptual game design goes, I have expanded in that area as well. Each of the five levels and bosses will have it's own state file. I may have a Menu state, depending on how easy it is, but that is not neccisarily essential and will be done last if at all.
